                    Depending on data availability, the due diligence process is based on cross checking official documentation, external data sources, and satellite imagery.  In the case of Brazil, the system is based on big data analysis and conducts over 2 billion cross-checks of multiple databases updated on a daily basis (<a href="">see report</a>).
